18.12.04 mxlpsolve 5.1.0.0 released
         This is the first release of this new MATLAB lpsolve driver.
         It uses ideas from the lpmex implementation for lp_solve 2.3 from Jeffrey C. Kantor
         but it was redesigned completely by Peter Notebaert for performance, functionality
         and complete support of the lp_solve 5.1 API.
